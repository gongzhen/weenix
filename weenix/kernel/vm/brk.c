/*
 * This function implements the brk(2) system call.
 *
 * This routine manages the calling process's "break" -- the ending address
 * of the process's "dynamic" region (often also referred to as the "heap").
 * The current value of a process's break is maintained in the 'p_brk' member
 * of the proc_t structure that represents the process in question.
 *
 * The 'p_brk' and 'p_start_brk' members of a proc_t struct are initialized
 * by the loader. 'p_start_brk' is subsequently never modified; it always
 * holds the initial value of the break. Note that the starting break is
 * not necessarily page aligned!
 *
 * 'p_start_brk' is the lower limit of 'p_brk' (that is, setting the break
 * to any value less than 'p_start_brk' should be disallowed).
 *
 * The upper limit of 'p_brk' is defined by the minimum of (1) the
 * starting address of the next occuring mapping or (2) USER_MEM_HIGH.
 * That is, growth of the process break is limited only in that it cannot
 * overlap with/expand into an existing mapping or beyond the region of
 * the address space allocated for use by userland. (note the presence of
 * the 'vmmap_is_range_empty' function).
 *
 * The dynamic region should always be represented by at most ONE vmarea.
 * Note that vmareas only have page granularity, you will need to take this
 * into account when deciding how to set the mappings if p_brk or p_start_brk
 * is not page aligned.
 *
 * You are guaranteed that the process data/bss region is non-empty.
 * That is, if the starting brk is not page-aligned, its page has
 * read/write permissions.
 *
 * If addr is NULL, you should NOT fail as the man page says. Instead,
 * "return" the current break. We use this to implement sbrk(0) without writing
 * a separate syscall. Look in user/libc/syscall.c if you're curious.
 *
 * Also, despite the statement on the manpage, you MUST support combined use
 * of brk and mmap in the same process.
 *
 * Note that this function "returns" the new break through the "ret" argument.
 * Return 0 on success, -errno on failure.
