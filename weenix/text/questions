in vfs_syscall functions
    - just want to clear up the mutex thing again
-------------------

in vmmap_map()
    - is it okay to not set vma->vma_vmmap before calling
      mmap? we're also told to set the vma_vmmap field
      in insert.
        - why the fuck not?
    - is it okay to have neither MAP_FIXED nor MAP_ANON, or both?

in do_fork()
    - how do we return two values?
    - do we have to copy the entire stack over?

in shadow_fillpage()
    - what's this about using the page identified by pf->pf_obj?

in do_munmap()
    - does len have to be page aligned?

-----------------------------------------

In general:
    - do non-shadow objects have their vma_olink fields set?
    - In mmap(), munmap(), and vmmap_remove(), should I be invalidating
page table entries?

in kthread_cancel()
    - should my assertion actually be commented out?

in do_waitpid_any()
    - is it okay that we have to have a while loop?

in sys_read()
    - do we have to do this in a loop?

-------------------

Potential bugs:
    - if s5_write_file() ends early b/c of an error, the file 
      size is still as if the entire write suceeded

    - Address space before/after list in vmmap_find_range
